<h1>CS 184: Computer Graphics and Imaging, Spring 2019</h1>
<h1>Final Project: Choreographed Particle Simulation</h1>
<h2>Yusuf Fateen, Brian Levis, Jayanth Sundaresan</h2>
<br>
<h2>Particles</h2>
<p>
    We implement a simple partiicle interaction rule, optimized by dividing the screen into a grid using the minimum
    interaction radius. At each timestep, particle pairwise forces are calculated and particles are moved.
</p>
<h2>Rendering</h2>
<p>
    Currently, frames are rendered as fast as particles are updated, which is determined by the input frequency.
    This pipeline is a bit limiting, and could be optimized.
</p>
<h2>Audio</h2>
<p>
    A python script converts an audio file into an extremely downsampled (low frequency and bitrate) magnitude signal,
    and saves the file. Our simulator loads this data file into memory, and uses a shell command to play the
    corresponding audio. The start time is recorded immediately following this call, to keep the simulation in sync.
